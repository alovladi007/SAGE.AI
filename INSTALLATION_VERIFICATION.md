# Get auth token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin@example.com", "password": "your_password"}'

# Test authenticated endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \

## âœ… Performance Verification

### Resource Usage
```bash
docker stats
```

- [ ] No services constantly restarting

### Response Times
- [ ] Frontend loads in <3 seconds
- [ ] API responses in <1 second
- [ ] File upload completes reasonably

## ðŸ”´ Troubleshooting

If any checks fail:

1. **Check Logs**
```bash
docker-compose logs [service_name]
```

2. **Restart Service**
```bash
docker-compose restart [service_name]
```

3. **Rebuild Service**
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build [service_name]
```

4. **Check Resources**
```bash
docker system df
docker stats
```

5. **Clean and Restart**
```bash
make clean
make build
make up
make init
```

## âœ… Final Verification

- [ ] All services running
- [ ] No critical errors in logs
- [ ] Frontend accessible and functional
- [ ] API responding correctly
- [ ] Database queries working
- [ ] File upload successful
- [ ] Analysis completes
- [ ] Monitoring active
- [ ] Documentation reviewed

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

If all checks pass, your Academic Integrity Platform is ready to use!

Next steps:
1. Review [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for usage guide
2. Configure institution-specific settings
3. Import existing papers (if any)
4. Set up regular backups
5. Configure production settings (if deploying to production)
