## ⚠️ What's PARTIALLY WORKING

### 1. Background Processing
**Status:** Configured but not executing

**What Works:**
- ✅ Job creation in database
- ✅ Job status tracking
- ✅ Queue infrastructure (Redis)

**What Doesn't:**
- ❌ Async background tasks not executing
- ❌ Papers stay in "queued" status
- ❌ Text extraction not running

**Root Cause:**
FastAPI BackgroundTasks with async functions may not be executing. The `process_paper` function is defined but not being called after upload.

**Fix Needed:**
```python
# Option 1: Make background task sync
def process_paper_sync(paper_id: str, content: bytes):
    asyncio.run(process_paper(paper_id, content))

# Use in endpoint:
background_tasks.add_task(process_paper_sync, str(paper.id), content)

# Option 2: Use Celery (preferred for production)
@celery_app.task
def process_paper_celery(paper_id: str):
    # Process the paper
    pass
```

**Impact:** Medium - Papers upload successfully but don't get analyzed automatically

### 2. ML Pipeline
**Status:** Code exists but not integrated with background processing

**What Works:**
- ✅ ML Worker service running
- ✅ Models can be downloaded
- ✅ Code is complete (1,358 lines)

**What Doesn't:**
- ❌ Not connected to paper processing
- ❌ Embeddings not generated
- ❌ Similarity detection not running

**Fix Needed:**
Integrate ML pipeline with Celery tasks or fix background processing

**Impact:** High - Core ML features not executing

### 3. Frontend Integration
**Status:** Code ready, but not fully tested with backend

**What Works:**
- ✅ API service layer created (api.ts)
- ✅ TypeScript types defined
- ✅ Error handling configured
- ✅ Build succeeds

**What Might Not Work:**
- ⚠️ Frontend may be showing mock data due to API errors
- ⚠️ Real-time updates not verified
- ⚠️ All 11 tabs UI only (no real data)

**Fix Needed:**
Once background processing works, frontend will connect automatically

**Impact:** Low - Frontend loads, just showing limited data

## ❌ What's NOT Implemented

### 1. Authentication System
**Status:** Libraries installed but not enabled

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Login/signup UI
- ❌ JWT token generation
- ❌ User registration
- ❌ Password hashing (library ready)
- ❌ Protected routes

**Reason:** Not required for MVP/demo

**How to Add:**
```python
# backend/main.py
from fastapi import Security
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer

security = HTTPBearer()

@app.post("/api/auth/login")
async def login(credentials: LoginRequest):
    # Implement login logic
    pass
```

**Impact:** Low for demo, High for production

### 2. Advanced ML Features
**Status:** Code exists but not executing

**What's Not Working:**
- ❌ SciBERT embeddings generation
- ❌ SPECTER2 semantic search
- ❌ Image manipulation detection
- ❌ Statistical anomaly detection (GRIM, Benford's)
- ❌ Citation network analysis
- ❌ LIME/SHAP explainability

**Reason:** Depends on background processing working

**Impact:** High - These are core features

### 3. Celery Integration
**Status:** Services running but tasks not defined

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Celery tasks in backend
- ❌ ML worker tasks defined
- ❌ Task routing configured
- ❌ Result backend configured

**Fix Needed:**
Create `backend/celery_app.py` and `ml_worker/ml_tasks.py`

**Impact:** High - Needed for production scalability

### 4. Real-time Features
**Status:** Infrastructure ready but not implemented

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ WebSocket connections
- ❌ Live progress updates
- ❌ Real-time notifications
- ❌ Collaborative editing

**Impact:** Medium - Nice to have

### 5. Advanced Search
**Status:** Basic search works, advanced features missing

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Elasticsearch integration (service running but not used)
- ❌ Full-text search
- ❌ Fuzzy matching
- ❌ Faceted search

**Impact:** Medium

## 🎯 What's Needed for FULL FUNCTIONALITY

### Critical (Must Fix)
1. **Background Processing** - Fix async task execution
2. **ML Pipeline Integration** - Connect ML worker to processing
3. **Celery Tasks** - Define proper task queue

### Important (Should Fix)
4. **Frontend Data Loading** - Ensure real data flows to UI
5. **Authentication** - Add login/signup for production
6. **Error Handling** - Better error messages in UI

### Nice to Have (Can Add Later)
7. **WebSocket** - Real-time updates
8. **Advanced Search** - Elasticsearch integration
9. **Monitoring Alerts** - Email/Slack notifications
10. **Unit Tests** - Comprehensive test coverage

## 🔧 Quick Fixes Needed

### Fix #1: Background Processing (15 minutes)

Edit `backend/main.py`:
```python
# Change line 519 from async to sync wrapper
def process_paper_wrapper(paper_id: str, content: bytes):
    """Sync wrapper for async background task"""
    import asyncio
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    try:
        loop.run_until_complete(process_paper(paper_id, content))
    finally:
        loop.close()

# Update line 519:
background_tasks.add_task(process_paper_wrapper, str(paper.id), content)
```

### Fix #2: Rebuild and Restart (2 minutes)
```bash
docker-compose build backend
docker-compose up -d backend
```

### Fix #3: Test Processing (1 minute)
```bash
./test_deployment.sh
```
