1. Detection Types

Text similarity: Direct plagiarism, paraphrasing, idea appropriation
Data fabrication: Statistical anomalies, impossible data patterns
Image manipulation: Duplicated/altered figures, charts, microscopy images
Citation networks: Missing attributions, citation rings
Methodology copying: Experimental designs taken without credit

2. Technical Architecture Considerations
Data Pipeline:

Ingestion: APIs (arXiv, PubMed, CrossRef, institutional repositories)
Storage: Distributed systems (PostgreSQL + vector DB like Pinecone/Weaviate)
Processing: Apache Spark for batch processing, Redis for caching
Format handling: PDF parsing (PyMuPDF, pdfplumber), OCR for scanned docs

ML Approaches:

Embeddings: Use transformer models (SciBERT, Specter2) for semantic similarity
Fingerprinting: MinHash/SimHash for quick approximate matching
Graph analysis: Citation network analysis to detect suspicious patterns
Statistical analysis: Benford's Law, GRIM test for data anomalies
Computer vision: CNN-based image similarity detection

Key Technical Decisions
1. Similarity Detection Strategy

Hybrid approach: Combine exact matching (for verbatim copying) with semantic similarity (for paraphrasing)
Hierarchical matching: Document → Section → Paragraph → Sentence level
Contextual analysis: Consider field-specific terminology and common phrases

2. False Positive Reduction

Whitelist common phrases/methodologies
Account for self-citations and legitimate reuse
Field-specific thresholds (some fields have more standardized language)
Time-based analysis (who published first?)

3. Scalability Solutions

Indexing: Build inverted indices for full-text search
Approximate algorithms: LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing) for billions of comparisons
Distributed processing: Hadoop/Spark clusters
Incremental updates: Only process new papers against existing corpus

Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: MVP (2-3 months)

Basic text similarity detection using pre-trained embeddings
Simple web interface for uploading papers
Database of 10,000-50,000 papers for testing
Basic reporting system

Phase 2: Enhanced Detection (3-4 months)

Add statistical anomaly detection
Implement image similarity checking
Scale to 500,000+ papers
API for institutional integration

Phase 3: Advanced Features (4-6 months)

Citation network analysis
Multi-language support
Real-time monitoring of new publications
Machine learning model fine-tuning on confirmed cases

Unique Value Propositions to Consider

Temporal tracking: Show how ideas evolve across papers over time
Collaboration patterns: Identify suspicious authorship patterns
Preprint monitoring: Catch issues before formal publication
Educational mode: Help students check their own work before submission
API service: Offer to journals, universities, funding agencies

Ethical & Legal Considerations

Privacy: Anonymization options for internal institutional checks
Transparency: Explain how similarity scores are calculated
Appeals process: System for disputing false positives
Access rights: Ensure compliance with publisher agreements
Bias mitigation: Test across different disciplines and geographic regions

Technology Stack Recommendation

Backend: Python (FastAPI), Go for high-performance services
